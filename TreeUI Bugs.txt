OBJECT SPAWNING NEEDS TO BE BASED ON SAVED OBJECTS, NOT CONSTRUCTORS!!!
High Priority:
Be able to place where a loaded tree is.

Theory:
Use the incubator to send synchronization data for multiplayer

Server sends everything to client
Server will only update around the client location
Server will receive mouse clicks and process using incubator
Server will yield to client for the interaction and active object
Server will create an inventory manager for each player.

Client sends mouse clicks(Not coords, just what was in the hand, what was clicked on)
Client sends vars of active object except pointers
Client sends vars of interaction object except pointers
Client will DISABLE object creation to avoid conflicts with server
Client TreeUIManager will check thread if it should allow object creation or block
Client will REFUSE to update interaction and active object

ISSUE: When an object is picked up, need to have a process to remove it from the ground
SOLUTION: Mouse click will handle that, simulate mouse click, object is removed from ground. Keep track of players inventory

How to keep track of players inventory?
Socket manager will need to keep track of it
Use the incubator maybe?
Other player inventory will be tracked via hidden inventory panels
The server will create an inventory manager for each player
