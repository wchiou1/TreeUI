The editor panel is causing problems. Maybe remove?
What does it affect?
Creating new objects are handled using that thing.
[TOP PRIORITY] Move object creation to the input manager
--ISSUE: Maybe redesign Incubator to be inside of TreeUIManager?
--TUIM stores go lists, incubator stores go lists also? Invert data flow from Incubator to TUIM. TUIM will be the master.
--Things to consider: How to create objects which will not be saved? Only editor objects will not be saved, just use an interface

Objectives:
Invert data from from incubator to TUIM
Add correction to incubator file write to exclude editor objects
Potential issue with editing, existing panels don't have editing enabled
Incubator is supposed to create objects that the TUIM then manages.

TUIM will have easy to manage intuitive functions(return the object directly)

ISSUE: Need to include items in the incubator otherwise you cannot modify their variables!

-Need to add tabs
-Maybe add search?
--Would need a scroll
Create a full game state save
Save network nodes
