Implement small objects
-Clicking on it conflicts with opening a originobject(SS13 deals with this via clicking on the object with the other while in hand)
-Remove switching the object in the hand(Do NOT do what Minecraft does)
-The inventory needs to get small objects from the ground somehow.
--Small objects return themselves?
--Yes, but an empty hand will trigger opening the smallobject
--CONFLICT:Open hand needs to be able to grab items from slots!
---Make exception for inventory slots maybe?
--SOLUTION:Use key press, E will mean that user wants to access the originobject,
Should click still access the oo? If empty hand then yes?(But what about switching hands?)
What about making E grab items?
SOLUTION: E to "Move" an item, click to "apply"
Should empty click still grab items?(NO)
ISSUE: Need a way to "Drop" an item(This will have to be done in the InputManager)(Also needs to be managed from the incubator)
The editor panel is causing problems. Maybe remove?
What does it affect?
Creating new objects are handled using that thing.

-Need to add tabs
-Maybe add search?
--Would need a scroll
Create a full game state save
